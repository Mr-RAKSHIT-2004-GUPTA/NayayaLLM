# NayaAnumana Legal Knowledge Base

This module builds a vector-based legal knowledge base from the NayaAnumana dataset.

- Input: Unstructured legal documents (single text column)
- Processing: Cleaning, semantic chunking
- Embeddings: Sentence-Transformers
- Vector Store: FAISS

The knowledge base is implemented as an independent module and will later be integrated
with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using Groq APIs.
